## What is DeskHog?
DeskHog is an open-source, 3D printed, palm-sized developer toy. 

It's a toy to tinker with, adapt, and to get curious with. We'll be folding in a library of simple example games and apps, including a pomodoro timer and versions of Pong, Rogue, Flappy Bird. You can see PRs for these in this repo now for inspiration!

We think that sounds like fun and, if you do too, then DeskHog is for you. 

## OK, but what is it?

DeskHog packs an Adafruit ESP32-S3 Reverse TFT Feather in a custom-made 3D printed case. It comes complete with a 240x135 color TFT display, a 10-hour battery life, WiFi, and a cute little LED so you can find it in the dark.

A [plug-and-play DeskHog hardware kit](https://posthog.com/merch) is coming soon (so you can get everything in one box). In the meantime, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need if you want to make DeskHog yourself right now.

## What can DeskHog do?

DeskHog can do a couple of things by default, but the real joy lies in expanding the capabilities by adding them yourself. 

### Out of the box functionality

A couple of basic [cards](#card-stack) (screens) are included on the firmware and were built by [Danilo Campos](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/31731).

- **ProvisioningCard**: Displays a QR code to connect to the device and shows connection stats.
- **InsightCard**: Visualizes PostHog data. Still a bit of a WIP, so contributions welcome!
- **FriendCard**: Lets Max the hedgehog visit with you and provide encouragement.

### Available games and apps

We're working on adding some of the following games to an `/examples` folder which will include a selection of games and apps for you to play with. If you can't see them in the `/examples` folder it's probably because they exist as [unapproved PRs](https://github.com/PostHog/DeskHog/pulls) while we work on them. No problem, just checkout the branch!

Example games include:

- **Pog**: A Pong clone by [Leon Daly](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/30833)
- **IdleHog**: An idle clicker by [Chris McNeill](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/33534)
- **One Button Dungeon**: An idle Roguelike by [Joe Martin](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/29070)
- **Dictator or Techbro: DeskHog Edition**: A quiz game by [Chris McNeill](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/33534)
- **Notchagotchi**: A virtual pet by [Sophie Payne](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/33385)
- **Flappy Hog**: A Flappy Bird clone by [Joe Martin](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/29070)
- **Hog Speed**: A reaction game by [Chris McNeill](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/33534)
- **Pineapple Reflex**: A pizza-based game by [Sophie Payne](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/33385)
- **Three Button Dungeon**: An Ultima-like by [Joe Martin](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/29070)

Example apps include:

- **Awkwardness Avoider**: A smalltalk prompter by [Annika Schmid](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/28619)
- **Pomodoro**: A productivity timer by [Annika Schmid](https://posthog.com/community/profiles/28619)

All of the example apps were built in 24 hours at [a PostHog hackathon](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/offsites) by people who hadn't coded before at all. These example cards are a testament to [what's possible when vibe coding on DeskHog](#-vibe-coding-with-ai-agents), but some lack polish - so make sure you know [how to reset DeskHog](#buttons-and-reset-sequences). Just in case.

## Developing for DeskHog

Review [tech-details.md](tech-details.md) for info on architecture, libraries and key components used in this project.

## Troubleshooting

### No matter what I do, flashing the board doesn't change anything! wtf??

We're actually cutting the storage space in half so that over the air updates can be loaded to the unused half of storage. You can end up in a place where the board just won't boot to the correct partition.

To fix this, choose **Erase Flash and Upload** from the PlatformIO Project Tasks menu.

## ü§ñ Coding with AI Agents

> DeskHog is optimized for agent development. If you've never tried coding with AI before, here's [a guide to get you started](https://posthog.com/tutorials/deskhog-claude-tutorial)!

We couldn't have built DeskHog without the help of agent development workflows, and we encourage agent-driven development with a few caveats.

LLMs often struggle with multi-threaded embedded systems. DeskHog‚Äôs firmware has strict rules for core/task roles; AI might overlook them unless you guide it.

If you're looking to [get started](https://posthog.com/tutorials/deskhog-claude-tutorial), we recommend using [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [PlatformIO extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode). They work well together and you can build all sorts of things with natural language.

Use `tech-details.md` to give your agent broad context on the device. Still, even with that you should bear in mind the following advice:

- You should encourage AI to follow existing patterns: use`EventQueue` for cross-core messaging and update the UI only on the UI task.
- Flag any AI suggestions that touch the UI from the wrong core.
- Review and test thoroughly‚Äîwatch for ‚ÄúLLM slop‚Äù (unused vars, odd delays) and clean it up.

Think of your AI as a speedy junior dev: brilliant but prone to mistakes. You‚Äôre the senior dev keeping it on track. With that balance, AI can boost productivity while keeping DeskHog reliable.

## Power off

If you want to turn the device off, hold ‚óè + ‚ñº for two seconds. The device will enter deep sleep mode. 

To wake the device, press the reset tab on the left. 

## UI progress
- Status card: working
- WiFi provisioning card with QR Code: working
- Friend card to give you (mild) reassurance: working
- Numeric card for Big Number insights: working
- Funnel card: needs a redesign; probably should be horizontal layout instead, won't display more than three steps right now
- Line graph card: broken, not properly scaling larger data sets, probably fine if you have an insight scoped between 7-30 days
- Other insights: not yet supported

## Request for PRs

The following PRs would be interesting, and may earn you a free DeskHog kit or other merch:

- Additional insight parsing and visualizations for Insight Card
- More games and apps! We think limiting things to one available button prompts creativity
- Support for other boards and displays
- LLM slop mitigation: if you see anything obviously stupid in this code that hasn't yet been caught and cleaned up
- DX improvements around task isolation: if your experience with embedded code says there's a better way to architect this, happy to follow your lead
- Improved C++: not my preferred language, feel free to suggest idiomatic and architectural improvements
- Desk utilities, like a pomodoro timer; also constrained: center button only. Be creative!
- PlatformIO config improvements: flashing builds causes a reboot that seems unnecessary, maybe you know a better configuration

## Forks

This firmware has a simple goal: make it easy to set up a stack of screens that you can page through easily, managed by a web UI. But this is just one way to use the power of the board we chose. Feel free to steal this code, keep what helps, throw out what you don't like, and try something totally different. If you get somewhere interesting with your fork, let us know with a pull request to edit this section!

### Community Forks
- **[joshlevitre/DeskHog](https://github.com/joshlevitre/DeskHog)** - Adds a Pokedex card that fetches and displays random Pokemon from the PokeAPI

## Feedback
